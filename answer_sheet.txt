## Data Cleansing Steps
## Add a week_no, month_no,year_no
## age_band Lookup 
## demographic Lookup
## ADD avg_transactions Column

CREATE TABLE weeklysales_cleaned as 
SELECT week_date, WEEK(week_date)  as week_no, MONTH(week_date) as month_no, YEAR(week_date) as year_no,region,platform,if(segment IS NULL,'unknown',segment) as segment,

## Data Exploration
SELECT * FROM weeklysales_cleaned LIMIT 100;

## 1. Which week numbers are missing from the dataset?
CREATE TABLE tbl_weeklookup(id int AUTO_INCREMENT primary key, week_no int);
CREATE PROCEDURE InsertWeeks()
BEGIN
    DECLARE i INT DEFAULT 1;
    WHILE i <= 100 DO
        INSERT INTO tbl_weeklookup (week_no) VALUES (i);
        SET i = i + 1;
    END WHILE;
END //
DELIMITER ;
CALL InsertWeeks();

## QUERY
SELECT  tbl_weeklookup.week_no FROM tbl_weeklookup
LEFT JOIN weeklysales_cleaned ON weeklysales_cleaned.week_no = tbl_weeklookup.week_no
WHERE weeklysales_cleaned.week_no IS NULL


##2. How many total transactions were there for each year in the dataset?
SELECT weeklysales_cleaned.year_no, SUM(transactions) as total_transactions FROM weeklysales_cleaned GROUP BY year_no;

##3. What are the total sales for each region for each month?
SELECT region, month_no, SUM(sales) as total_sales FROM weeklysales_cleaned GROUP BY region, month_no;

##4. What is the total count of transactions for each platform
SELECT platform, SUM(transactions) as total_transactions FROM weeklysales_cleaned GROUP BY platform;


##5. What is the percentage of sales for Retail vs Shopify for each month?
WITH month_sales as 
( SELECT month_no, year_no, platform, sum(sales) as monthly_sales	from weeklysales_cleaned GROUP BY month_no, year_no, platform
)
SELECT month_no, year_no,round(100*max(case when platform = 'Retail' THEN monthly_sales else null end)/sum(monthly_sales),2) as retail_percentage,
round(100*max(case when platform = 'Shopify' THEN monthly_sales else null end)/sum(monthly_sales),2) as shopify_percentage
 FROM month_sales GROUP BY month_no, year_no;

##6. What is the percentage of sales by demographic for each year in the dataset?
SELECT year_no as calender_year, demographic, sum(sales) as yearly_sales, round(100*sum(sales)/sum(sum(sales)) OVER (partition by demographic),2) as percentage
from  weeklysales_cleaned
GROUP BY calender_year, demographic;



##7. Which age_band and demographic values contribute the most to Retail sales?

SELECT age_band, demographic, sum(sales) as total_sales
from weeklysales_cleaned
WHERE platform = 'Retail'
GROUP BY age_band, demographic
ORDER BY total_sales DESC
